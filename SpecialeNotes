Make own example of outbox problem

Keep notes at meetings for the future

Can we make a nice library for kafka/outbox?

We want at-least-once-delivery + crash resiliance != atomicity

What is the failure model/How do we recover

Three phase-commit = similarity to the diagram

Setup docker-compose such that the example is ready

Action items:
	Fgure out what tech to use for queue and language and database
	Spring boot annotation "Transactional" - Aspect oriented programming

Next time:
	What the hell are people doing - saga transactions
	Look for other patterns - Three-phase-commit
	Look a bit into Kafka/RabitMQ
	Look at connection pool
